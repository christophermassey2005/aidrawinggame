AI Drawing Game Using Neural Networks, Unity, and C#.

An AI drawing game using Unity, CNNs, and GANs. The user can either draw an image given a prompt and earn points if it's good enough to be 
recognised by the AI, or attempt to compete against the AI which draws images of its own accord.

All the details are on this page:

Instructions:
1. First you need to recreate the data. Most of the detail for this is in the Github Pages link. The synopsis is that you need to recreate the Numpy
2. Bitmap files from the Google Quick Draw Dataset for each of the 30 classes. There is a Python script to do this.
3. Load the folder "Drawing_Game" as a unity project. 
   Everything else should work seamlessly from that point.

A PDF of the creation process/instructions is available for your convencience (the formatting is slightly better).
